# CellLipidGeneration
This repository contains the code I built to simulate a stochastic model of cell lipid production for bacteria. 

The mathematical model is not posted as it is currently being researched and refined by Dr. Stephen Krone and Dr. Andreas Vasdekis and is there intellectual property.
