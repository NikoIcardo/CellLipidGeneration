# CellLipidGeneration
This repository contains the code I built to simulate a stochastic markov-chain model of cell lipid production for bacteria. 

The code is presented as a word file simply so that it could be printed and brought to meetings. If you seek to run the file, simply copy and paste the code into the matlab IDE. 

The mathematical model is not posted as it is currently being researched and refined by Dr. Stephen Krone and Dr. Andreas Vasdekis and is there intellectual property.
